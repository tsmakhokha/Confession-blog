     I never loved my boyfriend. We have been together for 6 years and have a now 2 yr old son together. I can't seem to find my way out of this relationship. I have tried so many times to break up with him but he's is always so good with words and makes me feel guilty for even thinking of breaking up with him. I don't know how he does it but it feels like he has a hold of some sort over me. Of course he doesn't know that i don't love him. Although they say actions speak louder than words he still won't see. I can't exactly tell him that i don't love him coz i am scared of him. He has never raised a hand on me but he is very much capable, he has done it to his ex. Although he says he tries by all means to fight it, he is a very violent person and has anger issues, he's been in multiple fights and have had people getting protection orders against him. He has never been violent towards me, he says it's because he loves me and i believe him but i honestly don't feel the same way. You are probably wondering why did i date him in the first place.. i was young and naive. We started dating in high school. I was that bright little girl that everyone liked, pretty, and  the best in class. He was that cool guy that everybody wanted, neat and also bright in class. So when he approached me i just thought why not, little did i know what i was getting myself into. He's had a hold of me ever since. I could never stand up against him. He is 4 years older than me. He took my virginity, made me believe it is okay to even tell my mom about it which broke her so much i can never forget her reaction &#128557;,  he made me believe that he would never impregnate me and when he did, he destroyed me. He broke that little girl beyond repair. I literally  lost my happiness and i can't help but keep blaming myself for everything. 
I am doing 5th of medicine currently, i really want out of this relationship now more than ever coz i am scared of how he might take it if i wait until i finish. Please advise of a polite and respectful way of breaking up with him and getting it right this time around. I really feel guilty lying to him everyday that i love him when i don't. </div>
